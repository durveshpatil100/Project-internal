Exception : - 
 
   Try with resource :- finally not require directly insert into try (<here>).
   
   Collections: -
     Collection of classes and interfaces used to overcome the problem of array
	 
Comparable : - compareTo method 0,-1,1 
            only one compararison can be made in object
			
to overcome

Comparator :- compare method
          public int compare(Employee emp1, Employee emp2){
		  return emp1.getName().compareTo(emp2.getName));
		  }
		
Hashset : - override hashcode and equals method

Iterator  :- forward direction only
ListIterator :- 



Multithreading :-

      Threads are lightweight :- lightweight processess within processess
	  Context switching ?
	  
	  
	  xtending thread classe
	  implemting runnable interface
	  annonimous class which uses runnable interface
	  
	  -->
	  Runnable thread = new Runnable{
	      
		  public void run(){
		      //thread logic
		  }
	  }
	  
	  thread lifecycle:-
	    Different phases :-
		1.NewBorn phase:
		            As we create object of thread class 
					
		2. Runnable phase: 
		        waiting stage to be get executed. Thread schedularnot selected for execution.
	
        3. Running phase: 
                   run() method will be get executed
       
        4. Blocked phase: execution stopped for temporary time
		                   sleep(), wait(), Suspend(), resume(), notify(),notifyAll();
     
        5. Dead phase: Completion of cycle. execution is stopped permanantly
		               stop();


         Thread synchronization:-
		 only used during shared resources 
		 
		 
	Java 11 features :-
	
	1. directly run java file ..it internally compiles and run so no need o manually compile the java file
	2. even if the classname is different than filename program will executed and even if there are two main methods
	   then first one will execute and others are not
	3. File.writeString, File.ReadString
	4. httpclient to test api :- send request and receive response and get the data
	5. String methods are added
